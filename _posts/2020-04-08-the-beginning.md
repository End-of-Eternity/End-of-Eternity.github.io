***Hello World!***

I've been threatening to write a blog for a while now, and on the first of this month I finally caved and bought out a domain to start work on it. There's nothing much to see here yet, other than some nifty themeing curtesy of some cool people (who you can check out on the [about](/about.html) page) along with a few of my own modifications. In future however, I plan to have a guide on the basics of Vapoursynth, x265 and FFmpeg; scripting using Powershell, and other rambling about maths, software, video filtering ect. If you've got any requests as to what you'd want me to write about, whine at me on discord, or send an email to the (as of yet unworking) email address [eoe@eoe.codes](mailto:eoe@eoe.codes). Or don't, I don't care: GitHub Pages is free and the domain won't cost me anything for at least another 11 months, 27 days, and a few hours.

I better get to sleep.

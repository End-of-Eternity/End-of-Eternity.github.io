***This took far longer than it should have***

I got an email from Porkbun recently telling me that it'd been a year since I bought this domain (along with a couple other unused ones). Funny how quickly it's gone, considering covid and all, though I am disappointed to have only managed two posts, one of which being a "Hello World." Therefore, with the renewal of the domain lease, I'm going to try to renew this blog as well; and I have a few topics in mind.

The 'Basics of Vapoursynth' kind of post that I was originally going for was really kind of awful to be honest - whilst there aren't any in depth guides that go over that stuff, it's not particularly interesting to write that sort of garbage anyway. Instead of that, I plan now to talk mainly about issues I've run into whilst working with video, and Vapoursynth, and how I've found ways around those issues. This includes my thoughts about writing faster python scripts for Vapoursynth, explaining scripts that I have written for notoriously difficult shows like Steins;Gate, and my first attempt at porting an old, but still useful plugin ([CCD](https://github.com/End-of-Eternity/vs-ccd)).

If anyone else has anything they'd like me to talk about, feel free to contact me on Discord ([End of Eternity#6292](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360041519131-UserProfilesLinks)). I would advise you to email me, but the mail redirection still isn't working and I haven't been bothered to figure out why. Maybe later ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
